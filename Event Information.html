            <h2 class="header-text-2">BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p>
                <p>In May of 1864 the Campaign for Atlanta was in full swing, as Sherman's advances toward Altoona it becomes apparent that the Confederates are well dug in and it will be a costly. Making a flanking movement toward Dallas Ga. Joseph Johnstons Confederates are forced to re deploy on a line stretching from Dallas eastward on a 8 mile line past New Hope Church and Pickets Mill. On the 25th the Federal 20th Corps makes an Attack on the Confederate positions at New Hope Church and are repulsed, the Federal 4th corps that has been rushing to support this attack is slowed by the wounded choking the roads. Arriving late that night the begin to entrench. The fighting along this line went on for over a week although is not included as part of the battles of New Hope Church or Pickets Mill, the men writing from the rifle pits simply wrote NEAR DALLAS.</p>

                    <p>I take a few leisure moments to let you know that I am well after three weeks of hard
                        campaigning. The enemy has been in retreat and with the help of God we shall win our cause for it is just. We are very near the Rebs and we have dug us good rifle pits. We have been under fire for days but whenever there is a pause in the fighting we are close enough to the enemy lines to talk to them. We have had many men wounded also and they are under treatment at the Division Hospital about one mile to the rear of the line of battle. Lt. Southworth was recently wounded in the arm but he is recuperating well, at least the surgeon said that he will recover. This close quarters with the Johnnies is really bad for the nerves and there is a lot of sickness in the Camp mostly diarrhea but also nervous exhaustion. God willing soon this terrible ordeal will be over and we all can come home to our loved ones. I am tired of the fighting as I have had enough. Remember me to all my friends. I remain your devoted admirer.</p>

                <p>It was first in action at the battle of Perryville, and of its conduct the brigade commander said: ''The 24th Wis. went forward with cheers and soon engaged the enemy's right, pouring in and keeping up a cross-fire which made sad havoc among them. This was the first brigade to break. * * * Both officers and men behaved with coolness and deliberation, marching to the front with the steadiness of veterans.''
                </p>

                <p>The regiment proceeded to Crab Orchard and Bowling Green, reached Edgefield, near Nashville, on Nov. 8, and moved to Mill creek on the 22nd.
